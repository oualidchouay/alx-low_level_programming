function_pointers.h - header file for 0-print_name.c, 1-array_iterator.c, and 2-int_index.c.

0-print_name.c - function that prints a name using a function given as a parameter.

1-array_iterator.c - function that executes a function given as a parameter on each element of an array.

2-int_index.c - function that searches for an integer using a comparative function given as a parameter.

3-calc.h - header file for 3-main.c, 3-op_functions.c, and 3-get_op_func.c.

3-main.c - performs simple operations passed in as parameters.

3-op_functions.c - contains the following 5 functions:

op_add: returns the sum of a and b.

op_sub: returns the difference of a and b.

op_mul: returns the product of a and b. 

op_div: returns the result of the division of a by b.

op_mod: returns the remainder of the division of a by b. 

3-get_op_func.c - selects the correct function from 3-op_functions.c to perform the operation asked by the user.

100-main_opcodes.c - prints the opcodes of its own main function up to a specified number of bytes.
